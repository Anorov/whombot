==========

A simple Twitter bot that scans for recent tweets that use the word "whom". If the tweet is using "whom" incorrectly (where it should really be "who"), it replies to their tweet, correcting them.

You can see it in action here: **[@WhoNotWhom](http://twitter.com/WhoNotWhom)**

Example

Original tweet:

    I give respect to those whom give it to me
    
Reply to tweet:

    @UserName Correction: "I give respect to those WHO give it to me"
